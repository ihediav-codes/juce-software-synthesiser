    Simple oscillator class implements four basic oscillator types:
        Sine
        Square
        Saw
        Triangle

    These are not band limited, but should be fine in an LFO.
 
    Also note that the frequency and depth values can be abruptly changed, so
    please handle any interpolation yourself.
 
    Each oscillator will provide an outptu sample when process is called - this
    sample is in the range +/-m_depth.
 
    As this is for an LFO, a default frequency of 1Hz is defined. There is also
    a defaut sampling frequency of 44.1KHz, but please initialise this as necessary
 
    This class does have a dependancy on JUCE - but only for the value of double_Pi
    and the sine function in renderSine. These can easilly be replaced with your
    own definition on PI and the standard c math header for sin.
